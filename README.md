# csx99-report-latex

## Description

Automatically convert your staj report to Latex, if you are a Bilkent student.

## Usage
	
	My sincere advice is to get this template and edit it yourself and compile on sharelatex.com,
	Creating all text files and feeding it to the script sounds like an overkill,
	A web application could be less of an overkill maybe, but sharelatex.com is gr8 y'all. 
	Go on use the template "csx99.tex" there.

## Updates
